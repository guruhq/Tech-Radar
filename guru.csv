Dynamic Environments,Adopt,Platforms,FALSE,"DRI: Shawn C.<br><br>Currently, our Engineering team is organized as multiple product teams doing concurrent work against the same product with asynchronous deployments to a single static QA environment. This is a recipe for conflicts and blocking. Introducing dynamic environments allows for the creation of independent environments where code can be automatically deployed JIT. The dynamic environment solution is fully automated infrastructure code that integrates into the CircleCI CI/CD pipeline for code deployment. It's an optimal solution for large changes that have the potential of a blast radius that would otherwise impact/block the efforts of other engineers/teams if/when something goes wrong in a centralized static environment. The dynamic environment solution is available now for further trials. Further investigation is currently occurring into the cost implications."
react-query,Trial,Tools,FALSE,"DRI: ???<br><br>As we modernize our React implementation, we are interested in sunsetting our <a href=”https://stageapp.getguru.com/card/Tn9E4d6c/Fluxxor-History-of-GuruUI-Data-Stores?q=fluxxor” target=”_blank”>Fluxxor</a> state management solution in favor of a more contemporary industry-standard solution.<a href=”https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/” target=”_blank”>React Query</a> is a library that will help us to fetch, synchronize, update, and cache data with a tighter implementation footprint. The library is well-maintained, and documented, and has a robust community. We can implement React Query incrementally in parts of the application without needing an all-in implementation."
AppSync,Assess,Tools,FALSE,"DRI: Ed B.<br><br>As we evaluate our own tool stack, there's a Pub/Sub API available via Amazon called <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/"">AppSync</a>. Could this replace our current Ably system and be cheaper to implement and/or closer to our existing technology stack? Are there benefits to this?"
Mobile Technologies,Hold,Languages and Frameworks,TRUE,"DRI: Ed B.<br><br>Formerly React Native/Ionic. On hold due to Mobile not being a product priority at the moment.
<br><br>
We should evaluate mobile technologies, like React Native/Ionic, that would allow us to Write Once/Run Anywhere in a mobile sense. Right now our mobile apps are built with native technologies and need to be updated independently of one another."
GraphQL,Hold,Languages and Frameworks,FALSE,"DRI: Ed B.<br><br>On hold due to potentially large effort with unclear ROI. Evaluating alternatives to current REST approach and possible other benefits, GraphQL should be considered.  It's consumer-driven APIs is the common use case here.  The response is driven by the consumer, not the server, this makes your entire Data Model, the API, the consumer takes what they want from it. If the data models are composed of disparate information sources (RDS, Lambdas, other APIs, etc.), GraphQL resolves those into one API.  Implementation would be via AppSync, also noted in this radar for Pub/Sub abilities."
Monorepo,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"DRI: Cody C.<br><br>Currently, the <b>guru-ui</b> repo contains multiple projects like the extension, web app, sage story book along with other common libraries. This approach makes it difficult to work with across multiple teams.  Builds take forever for the smallest of code chanes in one of those projects.  Monorepo would postion Guru to take advantage of tooling that helps eliminate the bottlenecks and makes for a cleaner and more productive repo."
Operation PANDA,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"DRI: Armard B.<br><a href="""">Project Link</a><br><br>We need to standardize and document our event tracking so we can provide guidance to everyone on how to implement event tracking. Documentation for this operation is available in the <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X5usNhIJcxQH1WRNA2hLG1PkIsp_s3FFjYZh4oX72Fg/edit#heading=h.x7ah8lectshi"">Operation Panda Google Doc</a>"
On Call Process,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"DRI: Matt S.<br><br>After-hours production support is currently handled by too few individuals. While we fortunately only experience a  limited number of “pages” coming in today, the ask for these individuals is still to be available and this represents something that is both unsustainable and unfair. We are rolling out a new on-call schedule that will enlarge our on-call team. The effort here is to align  the new team, define the process, set SLA expectations, expand training, define STOPs, define a schedule, integrate a compensation plan, etc…"
Snyk,Trial,Tools,FALSE,DRI: Scott E.<br><br>Improving security posture should always be in the forefront of technical decisions or actions.  Snyk secures code as it's written and allows self-service discovery of security right in the tools the engineers use.
NX,Assess,Tools,FALSE,"DRI: Cody C.<br><br>When looking at moving from monolith to monorepo for guru-ui, the tooling to enable this is critical.  <a href=""https://nx.dev/"">Nx</a> should be evaluated.  It provides the ability to iteratively move to a monorepo, also provides various plug-ins and computational caching that would drastically reduce build times in the repo."
merge.dev,Adopt,Tools,FALSE,"DRI: James A.<br><br>As we continue down the Internal Communications/Intranet strategy, we will be looking at integrating with HRIS systems, the <a href=""https://merge.dev"">merge.dev</a> SaaS tool provides a standardized way to connect to many different HRIS systems and provide a canonical set of data for Employees and other records we might want. We should do a technical spike and trial this technology to determine if it does what it promises and how it could be incorporated into our product. This is in conjunction with work being done by Nicole/Brad on Team Hubble"
OpenAI,Adopt,Tools,FALSE,DRI: Yev M.<br><br>Our first implementation of Guru Generative AI features like Assist and Answers is leveraging OpenAI. Additional work is being done to evaluate alternative LLM solutions.
EMR 6.x + Docker Env upgrade for ML,Adopt,Tools,FALSE,"DRI: Yev M.<br><br>We're in the process of migrating to the newer versions of EMR 6.x for our offline training stack. Part of this move also includes using docker within our EMR clusters. Doing so has a lot of beniefits that include, stable environments, lower cost, faster execution of spark code to name a few. New offline trainnig stack, like the one for p-rex is already on the new stack. The scope of this is to do the same for our existing stack."
Model Experiment Tracking via W&B,Adopt,Tools,FALSE,DRI: Yev M.<br><br>Tools like Weights&Biases and ClearML for experiment tracking and model versioning will make iterating on our ML models quicker and easier.
Nvidia Merlin,Adopt,Languages and Frameworks,FALSE,DRI: Yev M.<br><br>Team Discovery is looking to adopt this framework to train and deploy more advanced and robust recommender system solutions within Guru without having to stand up a significant amount of new infrastructure
"Durango, a.k.a. Firesnake with a Firehose",Adopt,Languages and Frameworks,FALSE,"DRI: Yev M.<br><br>Team Discovery is looking to improve our firesnake data architecture so we can cut down on costs, improve data governance and set ourselves up for scalability"
Data Streams,Assess,Languages and Frameworks,FALSE,"DRI: Yev M.<br><br>There is a lot of value in being able to act on real-time context that Guru can see through the entire ecosystem (webapp, extension, Slack, MS teams). Further building on the data architecture improvements we are making with the Slack ingest API and Firesnake on Firehose, the idea is to assess how easy it is for us make use of real time user actions in ML services. This would open up the door for things like in-session recommendations and other applications."
Interleaving,Adopt,Languages and Frameworks,FALSE,"DRI: Yev M.<br><a href="""">Project Link</a><br><br>Interleaving lets us conduct controlled experiemnts (A/B testing) for lists of items using a fraction of data and time required in traditional A/B testing. It will be of essence to our ability to improve not only Search but Recommender Systems as well: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ecTEZcBN_gZEXLb_nisE7yKr2loCj8zsrF1ADEVqBE0/edit#"
Data Cataloging & Observability,Adopt,Tools,FALSE,"DRI: Yev M.<br><br>With our push to have the data lake be the source of truth for all Guru data, there is a need to properly catalog the data and include monitoring and alerting for data changes"
Dask & Ray,Hold,Languages and Frameworks,FALSE,"DRI: Yev M.<br><br>Spark isn't always the best thing to use for distributed workloads, especially given the overhead with the JVM. We are looking into using Dask and Ray to expand our abilities, reduce costs and speed things up on the Discovery side"
Sagemaker Studio,Adopt,Tools,FALSE,"DRI: Yev M.<br><br>In the spirit of continuing to iterate on the developer experience for Discovery, we are actively explorign where and when it makes sense to use Sagemaker Studio insted of EMR Studio"
Dependency Management,Assess,Techniques,FALSE,DRI: Ed B.<br><br>What is our strategy to manage all of our dependencies across all of our disciplines?
Stringification,Assess,Languages and Frameworks,FALSE,"DRI: Mitch S.<br><a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-lWr3L2QBcz9uRdtX13Tcmex7-sHuQyioI3oq5M_dyQ/edit"">Project Link</a><br><br>A foundational step towards internationalization is to stringify the parts of our application to provide the ability to translate the language."
Analytics Platform,Adopt,Platforms,FALSE,"DRI: Mitch S.<br><a href="""">Project Link</a><br><br>Evaluate our analytics platform to replace Looker - We will be adopting ThoughtSpot. Evaluation is here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-lWr3L2QBcz9uRdtX13Tcmex7-sHuQyioI3oq5M_dyQ/edit"
AI Coding Assistants,Assess,Tools,FALSE,"DRI: Need<br><br>AI Coding Assistants help to improve developer productivity, with the assistant serving an AI pair programmer. Leveraging prompts, a programmer is able to invoke the assistant to generate code suggestions that will follow the project’s style conventions. For example, “Write a function in Java that copies a file from my local file system and posts it to an S3 bucket that I specify.” How might an AI Coding Assistant increase our velocity, improve our confidence, improve our code quality in PRs, and/or help us to solve the least exciting parts of the development process? Options to consider include Github Copilot and AWS CodeWhisperer."
