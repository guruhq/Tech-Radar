Node Upgrade,Adopt,Tools,FALSE,"As part of general software hygine efforts in Guru, we should be keeping up with the latest LTS releases of software including Node.js.  This effort enables us to move all libraries to higher levels that support the LTS versions.  This improves security stance as well as enable future development efforts and technologies."
react-query,Trial,Tools,FALSE,"As we modernize our React implementation, we are interested in sunsetting our <a href=”https://stageapp.getguru.com/card/Tn9E4d6c/Fluxxor-History-of-GuruUI-Data-Stores?q=fluxxor” target=”_blank”>Fluxxor</a> state management solution in favor of a more contemporary industry-standard solution.<a href=”https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/” target=”_blank”>React Query</a> is a library that will help us to fetch, synchronize, update, and cache data with a tighter implementation footprint. The library is well-maintained, and documented, and has a robust community. We can implement React Query incrementally in parts of the application without needing an all-in implementation."
React Native,Assess,Languages and Frameworks,TRUE,"Our Engineering team is largely focused on building Javascript-centered applications – web apps, browser extensions, and slack apps. Further, our team is heavily invested in the React ecosystem. This all said, our business still requires native mobile apps for both iOS and Android. Building these apps requires native application developers with skills in the languages Swift and Kotlin. It’s simply not practical to hire these developers (likely one for each mobile platform) given our current priorities. As such, to date, we’ve outsourced this development, which has been problematic with respect to getting good help. <a href=”https://reactnative.dev/” target=”_blank”>React Native</a> presents an opportunity to build mobile applications with Javascript using React framework skills (unidirectional flow, props, hooks, etc) and native component abstractions(UI View, Button, etc..) – The resulting applications are generated into native apps that can be hosted in app stores. Our current native apps are rather rudimentary without a significant amount of feature implementation. We are at a good point to investigate if React Native can help."
GraphQL,Hold,Languages and Frameworks,FALSE,"Evaluating alternatives to current REST approach and possible other benefits, GraphQL should be considered.  It's consumer-driven APIs is the common use case here.  The response is driven by the consumer, not the server, this makes your entire Data Model, the API, the consumer takes what they want from it. If the data models are composed of disparate information sources (RDS, Lambdas, other APIs, etc.), GraphQL resolves those into one API.  Implementation would be via AppSync, also noted in this radar for Pub/Sub abilities."
Ionic,Assess,Languages and Frameworks,TRUE,"As we evaluate our mobile stance, the bottleneck of who can actually develop on native mobile platorm is a concern.  The use of a more robust mobile framework that enables a wider portion of engineers to contribute to the platform should be considered. This means the ability to code once in language/framework of choice (js, react) and deploy on native iOS and Android would be required."
Postgress Upgrades,Adopt,Languages and Frameworks,FALSE,We need to upgrade our Postgres environment to least the 1 less than the latest version. We should also create long term policies to indicate how we will sustain upgrades in the future as well as a short-term plan of execution to being the upgrade process
Dynamic Environments,Adopt,Platforms,FALSE,"Currently, our Engineering team is organized as multiple product teams doing concurrent work against the same product with asynchronous deployments to a single static QA environment. This is a recipe for conflicts and blocking. Introducing dynamic environments allows for the creation of independent environments where code can be automatically deployed JIT. The dynamic environment solution is fully automated infrastructure code that integrates into the CircleCI CI/CD pipeline for code deployment. It's an optimal solution for large changes that have the potential of a blast radius that would otherwise impact/block the efforts of other engineers/teams if/when something goes wrong in a centralized static environment. The dynamic environment solution is available now for further trials. Further investigation is currently occurring into the cost implications."
Monorepo,Assess,Techniques,FALSE,"Currently, the <b>guru-ui</b> repo contains multiple projects like the extension, web app, sage story book along with other common libraries. This approach makes it difficult to work with across multiple teams.  Builds take forever for the smallest of code chanes in one of those projects.  Monorepo would postion Guru to take advantage of tooling that helps eliminate the bottlenecks and makes for a cleaner and more productive repo."
Operation PANDA,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"We need to standardize and document our event tracking so we can provide guidance to everyone on how to implement event tracking. Documentation for this operation is available in the <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X5usNhIJcxQH1WRNA2hLG1PkIsp_s3FFjYZh4oX72Fg/edit#heading=h.x7ah8lectshi"">Operation Panda Google Doc</a>"
On Call Process,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"After-hours production support is currently handled by too few individuals. While we fortunately only experience a  limited number of “pages” coming in today, the ask for these individuals is still to be available and this represents something that is both unsustainable and unfair. We are rolling out a new on-call schedule that will enlarge our on-call team. The effort here is to align  the new team, define the process, set SLA expectations, expand training, define STOPs, define a schedule, integrate a compensation plan, etc…"
AppSync,Assess,Tools,TRUE,"As we evaluate our own tool stack, there's a Pub/Sub API available via Amazon called <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/"">AppSync</a>. Could this replace our current Ably system and be cheaper to implement and/or closer to our existing technology stack? Are there benefits to this?"
Snyk,Trial,Tools,FALSE,Improving security posture should always be in the forefront of technical decisions or actions.  Snyk secures code as it's written and allows self-service discovery of security right in the tools the engineers use.
NX,Assess,Tools,FALSE,"When looking at moving from monolith to monorepo for guru-ui, the tooling to enable this is critical.  <a href=""https://nx.dev/"">Nx</a> should be evaluated.  It provides the ability to iteratively move to a monorepo, also provides various plug-ins and computational caching that would drastically reduce build times in the repo."
merge.dev,Trial,Tools,TRUE,"As we continue down the Internal Communications/Intranet strategy, we will be looking at integrating with HRIS systems, the <a href=""https://merge.dev"">merge.dev</a> SaaS tool provides a standardized way to connect to many different HRIS systems and provide a canonical set of data for Employees and other records we might want. We should do a technical spike and trial this technology to determine if it does what it promises and how it could be incorporated into our product. This is in conjunction with work being done by Nicole/Brad on Team Hubble"
OpenAI,Assess,Tools,TRUE,"With the increased interest in adding more-and-more NLP into the Guru product, Team Discovery’s slate is filling and they have an interest in both exploring platforms that will make the team more efficient and enable them to leverage the most advanced cloud services and open-source models. <a href=”https://openai.com/” target=”_blank”>OpenAI’s</a> GPT-3 has enormous momentum and its interesting services are being incorporated into clever products like <a href=”https://github.com/features/copilot” target=”_blank”>GitHub’s Copilot<a>. Assessing the services and offerings of OpenAI will allow us to know what the solution offers Guru and how it might fit into our stack."
